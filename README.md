# About this project
This project is a course assignment of Software Engineering and Computing II. <br>
The final goal of this project is to build a software product, in Client-Server structure, 
to systematically manage a fictitious lamp companyâ€™s stocks, sells and commodities. <br>
And our team, with four members including me, is targeting to learn about specific techniques and methods to build software and gain development experience by realizing this final goal.
